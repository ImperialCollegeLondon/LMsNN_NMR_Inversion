Requirements
------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of libraries you might need to install to execute the code:
* python (=3.10)
* tensorflow-macos (=2.12)
* numpy (=1.24.3)

* matplotlib (=3.7.1)

Computer Device
------------------------------------------------------
All programs run under the server with Macbook pro M1.

Run
------------------------------------------------------
Run the 'main.py' will finish generated numerical synthesis data, model training, and the T2 spectrum inversion.

Data available
------------------------------------------------------
The data file contains the numerical synthesis data used in the study. Also the data of figures in the article are included.
